# !!!!!!!!!DANGER DANGER DANGER DANGER!!!!!!!!!  This is only used for
# tests, to help test7d and the like, where we want to test connecting
# from a pod to another kind cluster. On Mac, we can use
# `host.docker.internal`, but this does not work on
# Linux. Furthermore, if we try to use the 172.17.0.1 (e.g.) docker
# network bridge for kind, we get a connection refused. This is
# because the default listen address for kind is 127.0.0.1. With this
# Kind cluster config, we set the listen address to 0.0.0.0, which
# allows connections from inside of the container (which is on a
# different network, hence the connection refused when listening on
# 127.0.0.1)
#
kind: Cluster

  # WARNING: It is _strongly_ recommended that you keep this the default
  # (127.0.0.1) for security reasons. However it is possible to change this.
