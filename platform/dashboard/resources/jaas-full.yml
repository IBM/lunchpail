                            The associated item's level .status.conditions[].type field is monitored for any one of these conditions.  Once all items with this 
                            option is set and the conditionstatus is met the entire appwrapper state will be changed to one of the valid appwrapper completion state. Note :- this is an AND

                          as the clusterIP. "LoadBalancer" builds on NodePort and
                          creates an external load-balancer (if supported in the current
                          cloud) which routes to the same endpoints as the clusterIP.
                          "ExternalName" aliases this service to the specified externalName.
                          Several other fields do not apply to ExternalName services.

                                      tells the scheduler not to schedule it. - ScheduleAnyway
                                      tells the scheduler to schedule the pod in any
                                      location,   but giving higher precedence to
                                      topologies that would help reduce the   skew.
                                      A constraint is considered "Unsatisfiable" for
                                      an incoming pod if and only if every possible
                                      node assigment for that pod would violate "MaxSkew"
                                      on some topology. For example, in a 3-zone cluster,
                                      MaxSkew is set to 1, and pods with the same
                                      labelSelector spread as 3/1/1: | zone1 | zone2
                                      | zone3 | | P P P |   P   |   P   | If WhenUnsatisfiable
                                      is set to DoNotSchedule, incoming pod can only
                                      be scheduled to zone2(zone3) to become 3/2/1(3/1/2)
                                      as ActualSkew(2-1) on zone2(zone3) satisfies
                                      MaxSkew(1). In other words, the cluster can
                                      still be imbalanced, but scheduler won''t make
                                      it *more* imbalanced. It''s a required field.'

                                      or one of the vendor-specific APIs for volumes
                                      that persist for longer than the lifecycle of
                                      an individual pod. \n Use CSI for light-weight
                                      local ephemeral volumes if the CSI driver is
                                      meant to be used that way - see the documentation
                                      of the driver for more information. \n A pod
                                      can use both types of ephemeral volumes and
                                      persistent volumes at the same time."

                                          will be deleted together with the pod.  The

                                          Pod validation will reject the pod if the

                                          Starting the pod is then blocked until the
                                          unrelated PVC is removed. If such a pre-created

                                          this should not be necessary, but it may
                                          be useful when manually reconstructing a
