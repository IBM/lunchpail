# Lunchpail: User Roles

Here are some of the Lunchpail use cases, summarized by user role:

## Application Owners

Shrink-wrap and distribute code as binaries. Lunchpail bundles your code with the logic for deployment, scaling, load balancing, observability, etc.

## Platform engineers

Shrink-wrap the variants of base application logic for their team's use cases. These also become distributable binaries.

## End users and Automators

Stitch together the steps of automation, because each step is a black box shrink-wrapped application.

## Budgeters and Project Managers

Have your developers run the applications in a mode that only queues up work. Separately, one can use the same binary to allocate or reduce resources assigned to each queue, as budget allows.
